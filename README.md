### Description

We want to test the SMT encodings generated by
[agni](https://github.com/bpfverif/agni). Agni generates SMT encodings for
abstract operators in kernel/bpf/verifier.c. We want to see if the Agni
representation of these operators match the actual behaviour we see in the
verifer.

### Usage

First we want to follow the instructions laid out in
[this repository](https://github.com/bpfverif/linux-6.2-bpf-trace). This will
give you a linux VM with an extra tracepoint that gives us the final values of
register 1. Once you are in the VM using the linux-6.2-bpf-trace repository you
need to install a few prerequisite softwares and packages. First install
python 3. Then install the following packages for python packaging, prettytable,
termcolor and z3-solver.

Once you have installed these softwares in the VM, run the following commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/bpfverif/agni-smt-verification.git

$ cd agni-smt-verification/src

$ make

$ ./src/verifier_test <instruction> <register 1 value> <register 2 values>
```

Right now,only ALU instructions are supported. \<instruction\> can be replaced
with one of ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV, OR, AND, LSH, RSH, NEG, MOD, XOR, MOV, ARSH or
END. The register value can be any unsigned 64 bit integer or "unknown". The
output will be the values from the SMT solver and then from the verifier
tracepoint.
